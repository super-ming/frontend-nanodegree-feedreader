# RSS Feed Reader Testing

This application reads RSS feeds. I wrote a number of tests against the
application to evaluate the underlying business logic of the application as well
as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How to Run

Click [here](https://super-ming.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/)
to open the application. You should see the name of the specifications at the
bottom of the screen. It will alert you if any of the specifications fails.

## How to Run on Local Machine
